### Overview
Your mission is create either:
- Life-like cellular automata [life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), [life-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-like_cellular_automaton), [demo](https://www.netlogoweb.org/launch#https://www.netlogoweb.org/assets/modelslib/Sample%20Models/Computer%20Science/Cellular%20Automata/Life.nlogo).
- Breakout/Arkanoid [demo 0](https://elgoog.im/breakout/)  [demo 1](https://www.crazygames.com/game/atari-breakout)
- Space Invaders/Galaga

This project will be completed in phases.  
The first phase will be to work on this document. 
* Use markdown formatting.

## Phase 0: Selection, Analysis & Plan

#### Selected Project: BREAKOUT!!!

### Necessary Features
What are the core features that your program should have? These should be things that __must__ be implemented in order to make the program useable/playable, not extra features that could be added to make the program more interesting/fun.

- Method of movement
- Blocks must be destroyable
- Ball must move, destroy blocks, bounce

### Extra Features
What are some features that are not essential to the program, but you would like to see (provided you have time after completing the necessary features. Theses can be customizations that are not part of the core requirements.

- Blocks that can do stuff (powerups?)

### Array Usage
How will you be using arrays in this project?

1D Array:
- Contain the block class/block grid.

2D Array:
- Contain the block class/block grid. It should outline rows & columns of blocks for the grid.


### Controls
How will your program be controlled? List all keyboard commands and mouse interactions.

Keyboard Commands:
- Left Arrow > move paddle left
- Right Arrow > move paddle right
- Space > launch projectile

Mouse Control:
- Mouse movement: (?)
- Mouse pressed: launch projectile


### Classes
What classes will you be creating for this project? Include the instance variables and methods that you believe you will need. You will be required to create at least 2 different classes. If you are going to use classes similar to those we've made for previous assignments, you will have to add new features to them.

BLOCK
- Instance variables:
  - int Size
  - PVector() loc
- METHODS
  - Block() //constructor
  - void reset()

PROJECTILE
- Instance variables:
  - int Size
  - PVector direction
  - int speed
- METHODS
  - projectile()
  - void bounce()
  - void move()
  - void position() // not sure, maybe use to check when ball hits something, goes off screen?

PADDLE
- Instance variables:
  - int Size
- METHODS
  - paddle()
  - void move()
